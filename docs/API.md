# Silicon Commit API

The API is served under `/api/v1/` (for local development: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/`). Use `Authorization: Bearer <Silicon-IAm-access-token>` and `X-Org-ID` for organization-scoped operations. Mutations should include an `Idempotency-Key`; versioned updates use the response ETag in `If-Match`.

Core resources are `/todos`, `/projects`, notification settings, attachments, `/healthz`, and `/version`. The canonical schemas and status codes are in [`../openapi.yaml`](../openapi.yaml) and [`../API_DOCS.md`](../API_DOCS.md).

## Authentication and IAM webhooks

`POST /api/v1/auth/login` exchanges an IAM short-lived token (`slt`) for access and refresh tokens. `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` rotates a refresh token, and `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` revokes a token family. Mutations require `Idempotency-Key`.

IAM deliveries arrive at `/webhook/`. Commit verifies `X-Silicon-IAM-Event-Id`, `X-Silicon-IAM-Timestamp`, `X-Silicon-IAM-Key-Version`, and `X-Silicon-IAM-Signature` over `timestamp.body` before parsing or storing anything. Duplicate event IDs are idempotent; reuse with different bytes is rejected.
